## Hey, I'm Abbey 👋

I’m a Full Stack Developer with a strong interest in building clean, functional web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into working systems using modern web technologies.

If I get an idea, I try to turn it into a real project and improve it until it reaches perfection. And my current idea is a Score Keeping App between 2 players. It is proving to be kind of difficult to build from scratch 😅

My main tech stack is React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when they get the job done. And I use Figma and Canva to design stuff.

I’ve built projects ranging from frontend clones (Spotify, WhatsApp, Google) to a secure digital payment wallet system with authentication and transactions.

**Fun facts:**
- I enjoy breaking things just to understand how they work
- Martials arts 🥋 + Fine arts 🖌
- I like clean UI and even cleaner logic
- Hobbies: anime, building projects, art & craft, gaming
